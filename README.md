# GAN_SR_wind_field
Super resolve 3D wind flow based on data from the HARMONIE-SIMRA model, https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-abstract/OMAE2017/57786/V010T09A051/282088?redirectedFrom=PDF.

Dependencies for the python 3.9 environment are listed in requirements.txt. 

The model is trained, tested or used in a parameter seach by running the run.py file. Hyperparameters are set in the Config folder.

The model and test results, are thoroughly described in the following master thesis: [INSERT LINK WHEN AVAILABLE]

This work is besed on Vesterkj√¶r 2019's implementation of ESRGAN, https://github.com/eirikeve/esrdgan/tree/master. It is therefore subject to APACHE licence, described in the LICENSE.txt file
